# 1.4. Implement CRUD Resolvers for User Model

## Description:
Develop the GraphQL resolver functions for the User model to handle all Create, Read, Update, and Soft Delete (CRUD) operations. This includes implementing resolvers for queries to fetch lists of users and individual users by ID, and mutations to create, update, and soft delete user records, ensuring all interactions persist data using Mongoose and MongoDB.

## Acceptance Criteria:
GraphQL queries (GetAllUsers, GetOneUser(id: ID!)) and mutations (CreateUser, UpdateUser, DeleteUser) for the User model are fully functional and correctly interact with the database.
