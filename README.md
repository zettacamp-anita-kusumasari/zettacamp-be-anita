# 1.1. Initial Backend Project Environment Setup

## Description:
Set up the fundamental Node.js project, initialize version control, connect to a remote GitHub repository, configure a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files like node_modules, and integrate Express.js to establish the core HTTP server foundation for your API. This involves running npm init -y, git init, connecting your local repository to a new GitHub repository, creating a .gitignore file, and installing and setting up a basic Express application.

## Acceptance Criteria:
A Node.js project is initialized, connected to a GitHub repository, node_modules are ignored, and a basic Express.js server is running and accessible.
