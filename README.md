# 1.2. Database Setup and Mongoose Model Definition

## Description:
Get your MongoDB database ready by installing and configuring a local instance. Then, integrate Mongoose into your Node.js project to simplify database interactions, and define the Mongoose schemas for the User, Student, and School models, including their field types and the one-to-many relationship between students and schools. This involves installing MongoDB, installing Mongoose, establishing a database connection in your application, and creating the schema files for each model.

## Acceptance Criteria:
MongoDB is installed and running, Mongoose is connected to the database, and User, Student, and School Mongoose schemas are correctly defined with all specified fields and relationships.
